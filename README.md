## First Function: balls_animation

This function creates an animation in MATLAB where multiple balls move within a confined space, reflecting off the walls. It initializes the space, generates random positions, sizes, and velocities for 30 balls, and uses a while loop to continuously update their positions and handle wall collisions. The animation is displayed in a graphical window, and the program exits gracefully when the user closes the window.

## Second Function: balls_animation_pause

This code generates a MATLAB animation depicting the motion of multiple balls within a confined space, bouncing off walls. It utilizes a for loop to iterate through time steps, updating the positions and velocities of randomly generated balls. The animation includes the visualization of walls, current ball positions, and their trajectories. Unlike the first function, this version directly recreates graphical objects in each frame for simplicity. The animation concludes after a specified time duration.
